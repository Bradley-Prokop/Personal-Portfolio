    <h3 class="shadow txt" id="howItStarted">How it all started:</h3>
    <p class="txt2">
        I started my programming career at Moraine Valley Community College in fall of 2021. 
        I started out with python coding class because it was all that they offered at the time. 
        Right away I fell in love with programming and thought it was so cool. 
        Before taking that class, my desired major was graphic design. After taking the coding class, I realized 
        that my true major was in IT. I Then researched some schools with good IT programs and found 
        Illinois State University. I transferred over to ISU in the spring of 2022 and decided to major in information 
        systems with a sequence in web application development.
    </p>

    <h3 class="shadow txt">Progress and future goals:</h3>
    <p class="txt2">
        ISU's IT department makes every IT major take a class called "IT 168" which is a introduction course to Java.
        It is a prerequisite to all other classes in the IT field. It was a tough class but helped me improve my logic, 
        problem solving, and programming skills. It was in this class that I learned important OOP (object-oriented programming)
        concepts and skills. After completing that class I decided to expand my knowledge of Java and started to work on some side
        projects. After working on some side projects with java, I decided to transfer to front end languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        My main goal is too secure a job in software development. I want the work that I do to positively contribute to my future company as well as create
        programs that are helpful to people and solve real world problems.
